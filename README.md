# cepc_caltiming
Todd and Evan's repository for simulation code relating to the timing studies in the HCAL/ECAL at the June 2017 CEPC workshop



Rough Guide:

SimpleGenerator10\_Time.sh: run this script to generate a ".slcio" file that contains tons of MC information on a Geant4 particle gun generated event in the ECAL. 
-Edit the outputFilePath, which is the path where the slcio output file will be put
-Edit the particle type and energy

./Time/steer/MarlinArborHit.sh: run this script to generate a root file that contains branches with basic physical quantities about the resulting MC event generated by SimpleGenerator10\_Time.sh 
-edit input file information each time
-edit output file path where the root file will be placed
